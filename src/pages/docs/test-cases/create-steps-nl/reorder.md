You can easily reorder test steps within a test case to customise the flow and sequence of your test execution in Testsigma. This documentation will guide you through reordering test steps using the ⋮⋮ icon, enabling you to organise your test cases efficiently.

### **Prerequisites**

Before using Test Step Reordering, you must understand specific concepts such as creating [Projects](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/), [Test Cases](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/), and [Test Steps](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-nl/overview/).

## **Reordering Test Step**

Follow these steps to reorder test steps within a test case:

1. Create a **Test Case** with a list of the **test steps**.
2. You will find an **⋮⋮** (**vertical ellipsis**) icon before each test step. This icon represents the drag-and-drop handle for reordering.
3. Hover your cursor over the **⋮⋮** icon for the test step you wish to move, then click and hold the icon to grab the test step and reorder it.
4. Drag the test step to the desired position within the test case's list of test steps while holding it. As you move the test step, you will see a visual indicator of where the test step will be placed once you release it.
5. Drop the test step into its new position by releasing the mouse button. Testsigma will automatically update the test step order in the test case after you release the test step.
6. After reordering your test steps, click the **Save New Order** option in the screen's top right corner to save the new order.
